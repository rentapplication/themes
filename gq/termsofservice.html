                        <br /> Quilt is not an insurance company, instead we provide the products and services of our admitted insurance carrier partners licensed to sell insurance in your state. Not all products are available in all states. Quilt is paid commissions and may receive other performance-based compensation for its services.
                        <div class="legal-paragraph">The products we offer are only for people who live in the United States. We don’t and don’t intend to sell insurance products outside the United States, or anywhere Quilt isn’t licensed.</div>
                        <div class="legal-header">Our quote or total price isn’t locked in until you pay.</div>
                        <div class="legal-paragraph">Part of using the Quilt Tools is to help you get a quote for your purchase of insurance products. These prices change based on your answers to our questions during your application, your choices for different products, or due to changes of insurance pricing guides. For example, if you apply for life insurance just before your birthday, but don’t pay for it that day, it can cost more a few days later --- since it’s after your birthday and your price goes up as you get older. Whenever you leave your application before you pay, your price may change. Your price isn’t final and set until you sign and pay.</div>

It might include a video walk-through of your home or a picture of your dog. This space is important to us because it is important to you. There is a way to communicate with the Quilt team and share things you love with other people, too.</div>
                        <div class="legal-paragraph">We use industry-leading tools and processes to keep your information safe. The most sensitive part of data security is your password. We need to be able to assume that anyone using your Quilt Account as you, by using your password and credentials, is you. We’ll never ask you for your password. Don’t share it with anyone. Always use a unique, hard-to-guess password. Quickly ask to reset your password if any hint that your password and credentials are ever at risk.</div>
                        <div class="legal-paragraph">Also, by creating your Quilt Account, you agree that the information you share is true and accurate, and that you will keep your information up-to-date, complete, and accurate. This is important for both managing your insurance products and offering you exceptional service. For example, if you move to a new place, your policy will have to be updated since each state has different rules for insurance products and how they are priced within the state.</div>

                        <div class="legal-header">How to close your Quilt Account.</div>
                        <div class="legal-paragraph">You can always remove your Quilt Account and delete your data that we aren't required to keep. Due to insurance regulations, we and your insurance carrier keep records of required information related to a purchased insurance policy. You may also cancel any insurance policy you buy using the Quilt Tools. If you do cancel your policy, your state’s insurance regulations and the specific terms of your insurance policy will explain exactly what happens.</div>
                        <div class="legal-paragraph">If you stop using your Quilt Account and no longer have an active insurance policy, then we may remove you and your data from Quilt. Keeping our system clean and full of active Quilt Accounts allows us to offer the best performance and customer experience around. If your Quilt Account is removed, you won't be able to access it any longer.</div>
                        <div class="legal-paragraph">We may suspend or cancel your right to use the Quilt Tools (and remove your Quilt Account) if you don’t follow these Terms, our <a href="privacypolicy">Privacy Policy</a>, or any other Quilt policies. We may also suspend or cancel your right to use the Quilt Tools if you make a material misrepresentation or commit fraudulent acts related to the purchase, attempted purchase, or claim on an insurance product using the Quilt Tools. If we cancel your use of the Quilt Tools unrelated to your actions with respect to your insurance policy, then your bound insurance policy that you bought and continue to pay for is still a legally binding and enforceable insurance contract.</div>
                        <div class="legal-paragraph">We also may suspend the Quilt Tools at any time. Again, this wouldn’t affect your bound insurance policy you bought and continue to pay for each month. It would still be a legally binding and enforceable insurance contract.</div>
                        <div class="legal-header">Everything is “As-Is”.</div>
                        <div class="legal-paragraph">(Sorry for YELLING, judges prefer all caps sometimes.) Your insurance product isn’t part of this section. This is about continuously improving our site and tools.</div>
                        <div class="legal-paragraph">We work hard to make the Quilt Tools better every day. But, sh!t happens. WE CANNOT PROVIDE YOU ANY WARRANTIES WITH RESPECT TO THE USE OF THE QUILT TOOLS, INCLUDING ANY AND ALL SOFTWARE INCLUDED THEREIN, IT IS PROVIDED “AS-IS”. YOU USE THE QUILT TOOLS WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTY OR CONDITION OF ANY KIND, AT YOUR OWN RISK. QUILT DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT.

                        <div class="legal-header">These are the rules for limitation of liability.</div>
                        <div class="legal-paragraph">IN NO EVENT SHALL (I) QUILT BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR SPECIAL, INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING LOST PROFITS, REVENUES OR SAVINGS, EVEN IF WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES IN ADVANCE, AND (II) OUR LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTIES EXCEED, IN THE AGGREGATE, THE FEES PAID BY YOU TO US DURING THE LAST YEAR PRIOR TO THE DATE SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION ARISES.</div>
                        <div class="legal-paragraph">YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT (I) THE LIMITATIONS ON LIABILITY IN THIS SECTION ARE REASONABLE AND THAT THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION ALLOCATE THE RISKS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT BETWEEN YOU AND US (AND OUR AFFILIATES), AND (II) WE AND YOU HAVE RELIED UPON THE LIMITATIONS SET FORTH HEREIN IN DETERMINING WHETHER TO AUTHORIZE YOU TO USE THE QUILT TOOLS. THE REMEDIES PROVIDED TO YOU IN THE TERMS ARE EXCLUSIVE. Some states do not allow for these limitations of liability. If you live in one of these states, these limits don’t apply to you, and the maximum liability for any of these violations will be $100.00 in the aggregate for any and all claims.</div>
                        <div class="legal-header">Some additional miscellaneous legal terms.</div>
                        <div class="legal-paragraph">THE TERMS AND YOUR USE OF THE QUILT TOOLS WILL BE GOVERNED BY MASSACHUSETTS LAW EXCEPT FOR ITS CONFLICTS OF LAWS PRINCIPLES. ALL CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE TERMS OR ANY USE OF THE QUILT TOOLS WILL BE LITIGATED EXCLUSIVELY IN THE FEDERAL OR STATE COURTS RESIDING IN BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS. WE AND YOU EACH CONSENT TO VENUE AND PERSONAL JURISDICTION IN BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS.</div>
                        <div class="legal-paragraph">You agree that these are the Terms for your use of the Quilt Tools, and you have not entered into any other agreement related to your use of the Quilt Tools. We haven’t and don’t create any third party beneficiary rights by the Terms. If we waive or fail to enforce any of the Terms, it doesn’t waive our right to enforce the Terms against you or someone else in the future. You may not assign any rights granted by the Terms to any third party, and any attempt to do so will be null and void. Quilt may assign the Terms to any affiliate, subsidiary, or any acquirer of substantially all of the assets or capital securities of Quilt. If a provision of the Terms is found unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the Terms will remain in full effect, and we will substitute a replacement enforceable term reflecting our intent as closely as possible.</div>
                        <div class="legal-header">Our Terms will change as Quilt evolves and grows.</div>
                        <div class="legal-paragraph">We will change the Terms as Quilt and the insurance industry evolves and grows over time. The most up-to-date version will always be located at <a href="404.html">getquilt.com</a>. If you have a Quilt Account, we’ll let you know when the Terms are updated. Your continued use of the Quilt Tools, after a change to the Terms, means you agree to the Terms, including any changes. If you don’t agree with the Terms, please stop using the Quilt Tools.</div>
