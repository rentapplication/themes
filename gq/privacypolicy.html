                        <div class="legal-header">Quilt is serious about your privacy.</div>
                        <div class="legal-paragraph">This Privacy Policy explains how we get, keep, share, and use information from and about you. Our Privacy Policy applies to any and all uses of Quilt, like when you visit our site, buy our products and services, or share to the community using the Quilt Tools.</div>
                        <div class="legal-paragraph">We use industry-leading tools and processes to keep your information safe. And remember, privacy starts with you keeping your device and password safe and secure.</div>
                        <div class="legal-header">Let’s speak the same language</div>
                        <div class="legal-paragraph">We use the term “Quilt Tools” to refer to any of the products and services we sell online, any site information or tools provided on getquilt.com or our affiliated sites, any applications we develop for Android and iOS, and the growing community of people who use our platform. We use the term your “Quilt Account” to mean where you can find data about your insurance policies, your contact information, and any additional data you choose to add such as videos, photos, and property listings. When we write “we”, “our”, “us”, or “Quilt”, we mean Quilt, Inc., and Quilt Insurance Agency, LLC. And, any time we write “you” or “your”, we mean the person who is using the Quilt Tools (and reading this Privacy Policy.)</div>
                        <div class="legal-header">Quilt doesn’t give your info to others or collect data from kids</div>
                        <div class="legal-paragraph">Quilt doesn’t sell your information to any third parties – whether you purchase a product from Quilt or not. And, Quilt doesn’t want to, or try to, collect any personally identifiable information from or for any child (or anyone else who isn’t allowed to buy insurance). If we discover any personally identifiable information for a child, then we will delete it.</div>
                        <div class="legal-header">Quilt may collect data from you and your browser</div>
                        <div class="legal-paragraph">Quilt wants to build a smart, enjoyable, and simple experience for you. To do that, we track and collect information about you, your device, and what you do on our site or while using any of our Quilt Tools. Knowing things like your location, IP addresses, pages you visit, if you are signed in, pixel tracking, other cookies your browser is storing, and any information you share to connect with our Quilt Tools helps us save you time on forms and offers you personalized service. We also create anonymous statistics with this information to help us improve our security, experience, content, products, and notifications. We may share this anonymous information to teach and connect with more people or with technology vendors who support our web and mobile platforms.</div>
                        <div class="legal-paragraph">Since we sell insurance products, we can only sell to people who live in states where we are registered. So, we’ll collect or ask your location to let you know if we can sell to you.</div>
                        <div class="legal-paragraph">As part of your application for insurance products and to manage your account, we’ll collect information about your home, phone, email, insurance history, premium payment history, claims history, and some other information related to your life, too. If you don’t buy after your quote, we may follow-up with you about your Quilt experience and send you valuable tips based on where you showed interest. You may unsubscribe at any time at the bottom of any email or by letting us know via chat or SMS.</div>
                        <div class="legal-paragraph">Some of our insurance carrier partners require that we collect credit report information to purchase their products. We’ll notify you to get your prior electronic approval if this ever is true for you. We track and keep records of any emails, phone calls, faxes, SMS, chats, or mail you send to Quilt or communications in the Quilt Tools to follow regulatory rules.</div>
                        <div class="legal-paragraph">We’ll use email, SMS, your Quilt Account, and online chat as our primary way to connect with you. This includes sharing information about your payments, renewals, new features or product launches, and other recommendations. We’ll use the street address in your quote and Quilt Account for any required insurance documentation. And, we'll only use your phone number if it is urgent, if we can’t reach you through email or chat, or if you ask us to call you. We’ll share information, if you allow us to share it, with others using the Quilt Tools. For example, chatting with someone who went through a similar loss or milestone can help you manage that challenge like a boss.</div>
                        <div class="legal-header">You must get required insurance-related emails</div>
                        <div class="legal-paragraph">While you have an active insurance policy, you must get important emails we are required to send about your insurance policy, renewals, and claims. You may unsubscribe from other emails at any time. You can choose to turn off mobile notifications at any time in your device’s settings. Tell us what you like and don’t like, so we can send you recommendations that you love.</div>
                        <div class="legal-header">A few people who work at Quilt may need limited access to your account</div>
                        <div class="legal-paragraph">We may need to access your policy details and your Quilt Account to support you, manage your claims, or make sure you’re honoring our Terms. We use industry-leading tools and processes to securely control, monitor, and audit access to your information. Only Quilt team members who need to access your information will be able to access it, and we will limit what they can see and for how long.</div>
                        <div class="legal-header">Quilt works with partners to help cover you</div>
                        <div class="legal-paragraph">When you buy a policy using Quilt, it's underwritten by one of our insurance company partners. Your insurance carrier will get access to the information you shared on your policy application and any related insurance information you provided in your Quilt Account, like items you want to cover. They need to know this because they help protect you, too. Your policy will include information about your insurance carrier and its site where you can find their privacy policy and other information. We are available for any questions you may have about your insurance carrier or why Quilt uses insurance carrier partners.</div>
                        <div class="legal-paragraph">Quilt may share required information with our third party vendors, appraisers, or insurance reporting agencies to support managing your claims faster and making sure you have the best insurance product for you. All of these people and companies agreed to keep your information secure and private in order to partner with Quilt. So if you call us to let us know that your laptop was stolen, instead of sending an email or chat message, then a Quilt partner may answer the phone to get things started.</div>
                        <div class="legal-paragraph">We may also need to share your information with a third party if we are acquired or merge with another company, or are sold or enter bankruptcy. That’s not the plan, we just want you to know we’ll be thinking about your privacy if that happens.</div>
                        <div class="legal-header">Quilt will cooperate as required with the authorities</div>
                        <div class="legal-paragraph">Quilt is a regulated entity, so a government body, court, or regulatory agency may legally require us to share information about Quilt or about the people who bought insurance through the Quilt Tools. As part of a lawsuit or complaint we may have to share this information, as well. Quilt will do its best to let you know in advance, if that ever happens.</div>
                        <div class="legal-header">Quilt uses data centers in the US to store your information</div>
                        <div class="legal-paragraph">Our secure data centers are located in the United States. All Quilt data is stored in an encrypted environment and is also encrypted when it’s sent, unless you don’t use an encrypted browser when you use the Quilt Tools. We maintain our encryption keys for data storage systems in a separate environment from our encrypted data. We use SSL encryption to provide you security and protection while using Quilt, but we cannot guarantee the security of data transmission over the Internet.</div>
                        <div class="legal-header">Your Quilt Account needs to be up-to-date and is password protected</div>
                        <div class="legal-paragraph">We created a special place for you to keep all of your details and content in the Quilt Tools, like your policies, your key terms, and maybe a list of your insured property to make filing claims easier. It might include a video walk through of your home or a picture of your dog. This space is important to us because it is important to you. There is a way to communicate with the Quilt team and share things you love with other people, too.</div>
                        <div class="legal-paragraph">The most sensitive part of data security is your password. We need to be able to assume that anyone using your Quilt Account as you, by using your password and credentials, is you. We’ll never ask you for your password. Don’t share it with anyone.</div>
                        <div class="legal-paragraph">Always use a unique, hard to guess password. Quickly ask to reset your password if any hint that your password and credentials are ever at risk.</div>
                        <div class="legal-paragraph">Also, by creating your Quilt Account, you agree that the information you share is true and accurate, and that you will keep your information up-to-date, complete, and accurate. This is important for both managing your insurance products and offering you exceptional service. For example, if you move to a new place, your policy will have to be updated since each state has different rules for insurance products and how they are priced within the state.</div>
                        <div class="legal-header">How we process your payments</div>
                        <div class="legal-paragraph">We use industry leading secure payment processing services of <a href="http://stripe.com">Stripe</a> for all credit card transactions and <a href="http://plaid.com">Plaid</a> (which works with Stripe) for all ACH transactions, like paying from your checking account. Privacy Policies and security policies for these services are available on their sites. Quilt will not keep any record of your actual credit card, debit card, or bank account information, this goes for any of our insurance carrier partners too. This is to maximize your security.</div>
                        <div class="legal-header">This Privacy Policy doesn’t give you insurance</div>
                        <div class="legal-paragraph">The fact that you are viewing this Privacy Policy doesn’t give you any insurance coverage or prove that any coverage is in force. This is a publicly accessible page, that anyone is free to read.</div>
                        <div class="legal-header">Quilt may use a consumer reporting agency to fight fraud</div>
                        <div class="legal-paragraph">As part of our standard claims process, if you file a claim with Quilt we may collect information about you from an outside consumer reporting agency to research past insurance claims. We do this to reduce fraud, which is bad for the entire Quilt Community. If researching your past claims leads to your insurance carrier canceling your policy, denying a claim, or not renewing your policy:</div>
                        <ol>
                            <li>We’ll give you the contact information for the third party reporting agency;</li>
                            <li>You may get a free copy of the information supplied by the reporting agency by contacting them within 60 days;</li>
                            <li>You have the right to question the truth and relevancy of the information in the report by contacting Quilt or your carrier, directly.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <div class="legal-header">Our Privacy Policy may change as Quilt evolves and grows</div>
                        <div class="legal-paragraph">We will change our Privacy Policy as Quilt and the insurance industry evolves and grows, over time. The most up-to-date version will always be located at <a href="404.html">getquilt.com</a>. If you have a Quilt Account, we’ll let you know when the Privacy Policy is updated. Your continued use of the Quilt Tools, after a change to the Privacy Policy, means you agree to the new terms of our Privacy Policy. If you don’t agree with the Privacy Policy, please stop using the Quilt Tools.</div>
                        <div class="legal-paragraph">If you have any questions about Quilt’s Privacy Policy, email <a href="#">privacy@getquilt.com</a> or, as some states still require it, you can snail mail us letters:</div>
